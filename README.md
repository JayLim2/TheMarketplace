# TheMarketplace
It's my study project for improving my development & design skills in Frontend technologies.
And it's a prototype of a marketplace with all the popular features: ordering, selling, billing, loyalty program and so on.

I'm going to implement microservice architecture, microfrontend techniques, isolated & reusable authorization system as well.

I will strive to apply best practices of all covered technologies, the most necessary design patterns and methodologies.

Project will be covered by unit, integration, UI E2E and stress-volume tests.
